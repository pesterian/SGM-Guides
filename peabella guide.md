<h3 id="pea-x-bella-stuff">Pea x Bella stuff</h3>
<ul>
<li>Peacock’s g4 counts as a stagger, meaning if you tag in Bella after using it and use pummel it won’t stagger the opponent leaving you vulnerable</li>
<li>Diamonds won’t tag in Peacock at corner</li>
<li>Pummel doesn’t have enough stagger time to tag in peacock, gbreak does</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="mini-bella-guide-combos-and-tech">Mini Bella guide (combos and tech)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Bella’s CA counts as a stagger, meaning using pummel afterwards won’t stagger your opponent. Gbreaking doesn’t count as a stagger, however.</li>
<li>When doing ddrop during a blockstring, you need to delay it slightly to avoid getting a “too soon” message.</li>
<li>At midscreen after hitting ddrop, you can do a microdash (interrupted dash) into diamonds then pummel, and if a bit close to the edge and fighting a lightweight you can add a d2 before the pummel</li>
<li>You can do ddrop d2 pummel at corner on all characters but Parasoul (she’s your kryptonite as Bella)</li>
<li>you can “whiff” your ddrop by missing it to avoid d2’s end lag and get extra hits at corner (most effective against lightweights)</li>
<li>You can kill lightweights with this combo without them using a burst:<br>
– (at corner) launch d2 ddrop (whiff) d2 pummel launch d2 diamonds, then either do launch j3 or d2 bbutt.</li>
<li>You can do launch g1 d2 on these non light characters:<br>
–Robo-Fortune<br>
–Beowulf<br>
–Black Dahlia<br>
–Eliza (not at corner)<br>
–Double</li>
<li>launch j3 diamonds catches most (if not. I’m too lazy to check) non lightweights</li>
<li>Sweep has good range, use it more!</li>
<li>Your charge attack also has good range, but it takes a while to set up. Could be useful to gbreak in some situations though.</li>
<li>If you can predict when your opponent is going to use a burst, a well time bbutt can let  you avoid it and continue your combo</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="g-breaks">G-breaks</h2>
<ul>
<li>boxcar -&gt; doom -&gt; Bella tag in -&gt; g4 -&gt;bbutt</li>
<li>argus -&gt; doom -&gt; Bella tag in -&gt; g4 -&gt; bbutt</li>
<li>d1 -&gt; g4 -&gt; doom -&gt; Bella tag in -&gt; g4 -&gt; bbutt or diamonds should work</li>
<li>if guard meter is a little depleted g4 -&gt; doom -&gt; bella -&gt; bbutt usually enough</li>
<li>(very stupid) boxcar and george could give you enough time to tag in Bella and prompt your opponent to keep blocking which could maybe give you enough time to gbreak</li>
<li>not a gbreak, but if you hit doom -&gt; bella tag in -&gt; g4 you can delay and get ddrop</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="tag-ins-on-hit">Tag-ins on hit</h2>
<p><strong>After doom -&gt; Bella tag in -&gt; d2 you can do other moves if appropriate, like diamonds or ddrop whiff into d2</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>(this one is your bread and butter) doom -&gt; Bella tag in -&gt; d2  -&gt; pummel</li>
<li>g3 -&gt; doom -&gt; bella tag in -&gt; d2 -&gt; pummel</li>
<li>(corner) doom -&gt; Bella tag in -&gt; d2 -&gt; Diamonds -&gt; d2 -&gt; pummel</li>
<li>(corner) doom -&gt; Bella tag in -&gt; d2 -&gt; Diamonds -&gt; d2 -&gt; g4 -&gt; bbutt</li>
<li>(at range spam g5) g5 projectile -&gt; doom -&gt; Bella tag in -&gt; d2 -&gt; pummel</li>
<li>(at corner) doom -&gt; Bella tag in -&gt; d2 -&gt; g4 -&gt; Diamonds -&gt; d2 -&gt; pummel</li>
<li>boxcar and george on hit can let you tag in Bella<br>
<strong>Next ones are either difficult or very situational</strong></li>
<li>boxcar -&gt; doom -&gt; Bella tag in -&gt; d2 -&gt; pummel</li>
<li>(corner, lights) doom -&gt; Bella tag in -&gt; d2 -&gt; g4 -&gt; Diamonds -&gt; d2 -&gt; ddrop whiff -&gt; d2 -&gt; pummel</li>
<li>at a range <strong>set up george</strong> then do <strong>argus</strong>, if you timed it right after argus george will hit your opponent giving you a split second to use <strong>doom</strong> then you can do the usual Bella tag in d2 pummel</li>
</ul>
